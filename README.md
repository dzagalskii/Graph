# Graph
### C class describing graph/orgraph. The class supports the following functionality:
- definition of number of tops;
- define the number of edges (arcs)
- determination of the degree of arbitrary vertex (for orgraph - half-stages of exit and approach);
- define the power sequence of the graph;
- definition of a matrix of contiguity;
- definition of a matrix of incidence;
- definition of the list of contiguity;
- define hanging vertices, define isolated vertices;
- determination of origins and effluents in the orgraph;
- defines the distance between two vertices;
- determination of eccentricity of top;
- determination of diameter of the count;
- determination of radius of the count;
- definition of the center of the count;
- definition of peripheral tops;
- add/delete vertex to graph;
- add/remove edge to graph;
- definition of addition of the count;
- subdivision of an edge;
- tightening of the count;
- identification of tops;
- duplication of top;
- reproduction of top;
- association (disjunctive) counts;
- connection of counts;
- work by counts;
- input/output of graphs to text file as adjacency list
